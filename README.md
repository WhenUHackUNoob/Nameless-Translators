## For contributors

To have the slash commands work in your (testing) server, head to the command handler and change the guild ID in the command loading part to your own server its ID. 

To do list:

- Add translations to stats image (Not a priority, can wait.)
- Add more translatable languages (Used through weblate)
- Add ability to change user language (Priority. Will work on this ASAP.)
